<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Thomas, i'm a 19 year old college student in Stockton CA.
  I love to code and aspire to be a software engineer.
</p>

<p>Some of my hobbies include coding, reading, working out, and working on cars!
  I love working on cars because I enjoy finding solutions and solving problems.
  In a lot of ways it's exactly why I love code so much, although there can be problems
  and bugs it's so much fun to try to tweak them and get it just right.
</p>

<p>My favorite food is probably Sopez, or Tamalas. I have a girlfriend whom I love a ton
  She supports my coding journey, and supports my ambitions. I have a big family
  with a ton of sisters. I have 3 older and 3 younger and a older brother!
  We're a big family and we have a lot of love! 
</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy my projects!
